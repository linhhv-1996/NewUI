##### Hi, I'm Lin Dane

I'm an indie hacker, entrepreneur, and solo founder who's passionate about building and growing successful online businesses. I'm thrilled to share my journey with you on this blog.

##### My Story
After years of working on various projects and experimenting with different ideas, I finally cracked the code to building profitable online applications. 

Today, I'm proud to say that my three apps generate a combined $8,000 in monthly recurring revenue (MRR).

My journey hasn't been easy, and I've faced my fair share of setbacks and failures. But I've always been driven by a passion for creating something from scratch and making a meaningful impact on people's lives.

##### My Mission

Through this blog, I want to share my experiences, insights, and lessons learned with fellow entrepreneurs and indie hackers. My goal is to inspire, educate, and empower others to build their own successful online businesses.

I'll be sharing in-depth guides, tutorials, and case studies on how I built and grew my apps, as well as my strategies for marketing, sales, and customer acquisition. I'll also be sharing my thoughts on the latest trends and technologies in the industry.

- Honest and transparent insights into my entrepreneurial journey
