Unlike assistants of the past, Jace operates independently, tackling tasks and solving problems without needing your constant input.

But how exactly can this self sufficient AI become an invaluable asset in your life? 

Let's find out.

#### Jace - New AI Assistant

[Zeta Labs](https://www.zetalabs.ai/), a startup based in London, has revealed their latest creation. Named Jace, an AI agent, the company was founded by [Fryderyk Wiatrowski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fryderyk-wiatrowski) and [Peter Albert](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-k-albert/s), ex employees at Meta. Jace is designed to perform tasks directly in web browsers based on voice commands or text instructions.

Eight years ago, Albert recognized the potential for an AI assistant while managing an e-commerce business. His team faced tedious tasks such as transferring data between different systems. As technology advanced, particularly with the maturity of language models like GPT, Albert teamed up with another engineer from Meta, Wiatrowski. Together, they founded Zeta Labs and focused on developing their flagship product, [Jace](https://www.jace.ai/).

[Jace](https://www.jace.ai/) represents their vision, a sophisticated AI tool designed to streamline and automate various business operations. The company recently raised **$2.9 million** in a pre seed round of funding. This early stage investment was led by **Daniel Gross**, former head of AI at Y Combinator, and **Nat Friedman**, the former CEO of GitHub. The startup is collaborating with several early partners to enhance its technology and capabilities.
The pre seed funding will be used to make Jace, the startup's key product, more reliable and faster. In addition to the early partners, the startup received investments from multiple angel investors and venture capital firms. Some notable investors include **Shawn Wang**, **Bartek Pucek**, and **Mati Staniszewski**, the founder of Eleven Labs.

These investors bring not only financial support, but also valuable expertise and connections in the tech industry. AI agents have been getting a lot of attention in the news recently, with cognition's Devon being one of the most popular. However, Zeta Labs claims that their AI agent is different and even more advanced. It stands out because of its ability to work autonomously without supervision.

#### Jace AI Agent Features and Capabilities
Jace can control and perform actions in a web browser just like a human would. It can navigate websites, click on links, fill out forms, and interact with web pages in a very natural and efficient way.

Imagine having a smart assistant who can do all your online tasks for you. That's what Jace is like. One of the key strengths of Jace is its ability to handle complex tasks.

For instance, it can automate repetitive actions, such as logging into multiple accounts, scraping information from websites, or making online purchases. This is incredibly useful for businesses and individuals who need to perform these tasks frequently but want to save time and reduce errors.

For example, imagine a user who wants to book a specific hotel in Paris for a particular week. With the help of Jace, this task becomes easy. Jace doesn't just search the web for information about the hotel, similar to how perplexity does, it goes a step further by visiting the hotel's website and making the booking, including completing the payment process. This means Jace can handle everything from start to finish, saving the user a lot of time and effort.

Albert explained that this feature gives AI chatbots the ability to not just generate text, but also perform a wide range of tasks, such as replying to emails, setting up a recruitment process on LinkedIn, managing inventory, or even launching advertising campaigns. What's remarkable about Jace is that it can do all these things by working within a browser in the cloud. This means users don't need to install any special software on their devices.

Instead, Jace operates online, leveraging powerful cloud based technology to get things done efficiently. Whether it's handling everyday tasks or managing more intricate projects, Jace adds practical arms and legs to AI, making it a highly capable assistant for a variety of needs.

Jace also excels in web interaction. It can understand and respond to different elements on a web page, such as buttons, text boxes and menus. This makes it very versatile because it can adapt to various websites and perform the required actions accurately.

Moreover, Jace can directly communicate with web services and APIs. This means it can send and receive data from different online platforms, allowing it to integrate seamlessly with other systems and software.

For example, it can automatically update a database with information gathered from the web, or it can trigger certain actions in another application based on web interactions.

A good example is when recruiters need to find candidates on LinkedIn and organize their information in Airtable. Right now, this process is done manually. Recruiters use specific search terms to find candidates, then copy and paste their information into Airtable. After that, they calculate an internal score and use it to match candidates to job requirements. But with Jace, this whole process can be automated. Jace can search LinkedIn automatically based on criteria set by recruiters. It can then gather all the necessary information and directly input it into Airtable.

Jace can even calculate the internal score and use it to match candidates to the right job openings. Automating this pipeline with Jace saves recruiters a lot of time and effort.

In a demonstration, Jace managed to do something quite impressive. It built an entire company from scratch. Jace AI didn't just come up with the idea. It created a detailed business plan and went through all the necessary steps to officially register the company.But it didn't stop there.

Jace AI also found its first client, which means it was able to make money right from the start. What makes this even more interesting is that users can watch how Jace AI works while it's doing all this. The AI operates through a browser, and you can switch the layout to see different aspects of what it's doing.

For instance, you might see how it's researching potential clients, drafting emails, or filling out forms for business registration. This transparency allows users to understand the process and see the AI in action, providing a unique insight into how such an advanced system can handle complex real world tasks.

How Jace works at its core, Jace is a simple and user friendly web agent, similar to ChatGPT. You start by typing into the chat box, interacting with the bot, and describing what you need it to do. This could be anything from finding information to performing specific tasks online.

Once you've given Jace your instructions, you can refine or add more details through follow up prompts that look like little widgets. These prompts help guide the conversation and make sure Jace understands exactly what you want after you've provided all the necessary information. Jace uses advanced AI models to get to work.

It creates a detailed plan based on your instructions, gathers the needed information, and takes the necessary actions right in your web browser. The goal of Jace is to make your life easier by handling complex tasks and finding information quickly and efficiently. It's designed to be as intuitive as possible, so you don't need to be a tech expert to use it.

Just describe what you need and Jace takes care of the rest, making it a powerful assistant for everyday tasks on the Internet.

#### The Brain Behind Jace Functionalities

Jace uses a combination of two powerful models to carry out tasks. 

The first model is a top notch large language model that excels at handling chat based interactions. This model is responsible for talking to users, understanding their needs, and gathering the necessary information. After collecting the information, this LLM creates a detailed plan of action based on the user's requirements. 

The second model Jace uses is called AWA one, which stands for autonomous web agent one. This model was developed by Zeta Labs specifically for interacting with websites. Once the LLM has created a plan, AWA one steps in to carry it out. This model translates the plan into actions that can be performed in a web browser.

For example, if the plan involves booking a flight or filling out an online form, AWA one can navigate the website, click the necessary buttons, and input the required information.

AWA one is especially good at dealing with the common challenges and inconsistencies found in web interfaces. Websites often have different layouts, buttons, and ways of doing things, which can be confusing for regular users and other AI models.

However, AWA one is designed to handle these variations smoothly, ensuring that the tasks are completed accurately and efficiently. The company core model is built on an open source foundation, which means it is a freely available model that anyone can use and improve to make it smarter and better suited for needs. The company added their data set and used a method called reinforcement learning from AI feedback. This process involves training the model with feedback from AI to help it learn and improve over time.

Wiatrowski explained to VentureBeat that the company didn't stop there. They also fine tuned the model on top of this open source base, making it even more precise and capable. They used a lot of simulated interactions and synthetic data. Essentially, they created a large number of pretend scenarios and artificial data points to train the model. This way, the model could practice and learn to handle complex tasks on the web that involve multiple steps.

In some situations, web agents can get stuck in loops when they have to handle tasks that involve ten or more steps. To prevent this, Jace uses special reasoning systems. These systems check to see if each step of the plan has been completed or not. This approach is part of a different way of thinking about how AI works, where there are different parts that work together to handle more complex tasks. According to Wiatrowski, Jace can now handle tasks that involve hundreds of steps, which is a big improvement.

Jace also includes safety measures to protect the user's information.

For example, when someone uses Jace to post a job on LinkedIn, the credentials they provide are stored in a way that's encrypted. The information is kept secure, similar to how passwords are stored safely. These measures ensure that while Jace is capable of handling complex tasks, it also prioritizes keeping sensitive data safe from unauthorized access.

#### Future Direction of Jace
Zeta Labs is currently focusing on refining its AI agent, named Jace. Before making money from it, the company is collaborating with several design partners to make Jace even better and ready for everyone to use. 

Alongside this, they're also working on a second version of their AWA model. This new version will be much bigger and faster, making it more capable of handling longer and more complicated tasks. It's especially designed to work well with visual tasks like using maps. 

Soon, Zeta Labs plans to offer a free version of Jace with some restrictions on how many messages you can use. Once users exceed these limits, they will need to pay a fixed monthly fee of $45 to continue using the service. Jace represents the next generation of AI agents moving far beyond the capabilities of current AI chatbots like chat GPT, that primarily generate text.

While chatbots like ChatGPT are great at having conversations and providing information, Jace is designed to actively take actions in the digital world. What sets Jace apart is its advanced cognitive architecture that allows it to think and understand at a much deeper level. Because of this, Jace can handle tasks that are much more complex and difficult compared to what typical chatbots can manage.

#### Conclusion
In conclusion, Jace represents a significant leap forward in AI technology.

By breaking traditional molds, this revolutionary agent opens up new possibilities for human-AI interaction and problem-solving. As we continue to explore and refine AI capabilities, tools like Jace pave the way for more intuitive, adaptable, and powerful artificial intelligence that can truly augment human potential. 

The future of AI is here, and its name is Jace.
