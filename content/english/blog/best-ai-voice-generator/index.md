Today we\'re going to look at how you can use the most realistic sounding text to speech software that currently exists.

Here's an example of what it sounds like.


<audio controls=""><source src="/sounds/1.mp3"></audio>

Now, I don't know about you, but for me personally, that sounds like an actual human read that text. The vocal emotion, the intonation, it all just sounds so realistic.

And in fact, it probably sounds even more realistic or more human like than I do. 

Let's check out how you can use this for free right now.

#### Eleven Labs Homepage

{{< image src="images/blog/best-ai-voice-generator/2.webp" alt="alter-text" height="" width="1920px" class="img-fluid mb-3" caption="" webp="true" position="float-left" >}}

To start turning text into speech, head to the Eleven Labs homepage.

You can click on the card in the top right hand corner, or you can also click on the link here:

**Try ElevenLabs for free: [elevenlabs.io/](http://elevenlabs.io/?from=vanlinhhoang2316)**

You don't even have to set up an account, you can just type in some text. And right here you can select a voice to narrate that text.

{{< image src="images/blog/best-ai-voice-generator/3.webp" alt="alter-text" height="" width="1920px" class="img-fluid mb-3" caption="" webp="true" position="float-left" >}}

Here you have all of these different pre made voices. And later on we'll look at how you can even create your own customized voice. 

You have a mix of males and also females.

Once you're ready to generate your speech, you can click on this play icon right down below. On the homepage you are limited by how many characters you can turn into speech to be able to turn more text into speech.

#### Eleven Labs Plans

{{< image src="images/blog/best-ai-voice-generator/4.webp" alt="alter-text" height="" width="1920px" class="img-fluid mb-3" caption="" webp="true" position="float-left" >}}

Up above, let's click on the pricing tab.

This drops us onto the pricing page and here we see all of the available plans. 

Now the great news is the base plan is entirely free. So here you could test out speech synthesis to see how it works.

Right down here **on the free plan, you get up to 10,000 characters per month that you can convert into speech,** and that that works out to **about 10 minutes** worth of speech each. One of the drawbacks of the free plan is you cannot use it commercially and you also have to attribute back to eleven labs.

The next plan up is the starter plan, and this one's attractively priced. For the first month it's only $1 and then it jumps up to $5. And the key difference is **you get up to 30,000 characters per month that you can convert into speech,** and **that works out to about 30 minutes**. And one of the really great parts of this is you get instant voice cloning. What this means is I can upload, let's say, myself talking and then I can type and it'll speak back using my voice.

That's pretty incredible.

#### Speech Synthesis

{{< image src="images/blog/best-ai-voice-generator/5.webp" alt="alter-text" height="" width="1920px" class="img-fluid mb-3" caption="" webp="true" position="float-left" >}}

In the top right hand corner I'll click on sign in, but if you don't yet have an account, feel free to sign up for a free account. Once you finish setting up your account, we drop into speech synthesis and this is where we can type in some text and it'll generate speed speech based on that text. 

The benefit of going through an account is you get a much larger quota to convert text into speech.

{{< image src="images/blog/best-ai-voice-generator/6.webp" alt="alter-text" height="" width="1920px" class="img-fluid mb-3" caption="" webp="true" position="float-left" >}}

In the Voice tab, you could select one of these voices and here you could even preview what these voices sound like by clicking on the preview icon. It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it. You can go through and listen to all the different options.

{{< image src="images/blog/best-ai-voice-generator/7.webp" alt="alter-text" height="" width="1920px" class="img-fluid mb-3" caption="" webp="true" position="float-left" >}}

Back to Speech tab, you also have voice settings and here you could adjust things like the stability. 

If you go down to the left where it's more variable, this will cause the voice to sound more expressive. Here you could also modify the similarity enhancement.

You could try adjusting these different values to see how that affects the voice. 

Here, for instance, I'll type in text. 

Unfortunately, I have some bad news to report, so it's bad news. So the voice will probably be a little bit more downbeat and it'll factor that into the way it delivers the voice and it's pretty incredible.

Right down below all I need to do is click on generate and then we can listen to the voice.

> Unfortunately I have some bad news to report. Mrs.Fields won best cookie of the year and not the Lin Dane company.

<audio controls=""><source src="/sounds/2.mp3"></audio>

That sounded really human like. I am still just blown away by how good this technology has gotten. Right up above I can change the message and maybe we go with something a little bit more positive or upbeat.

#### Add Voice Using Voice Design 

{{< image src="images/blog/best-ai-voice-generator/8.webp" alt="alter-text" height="" width="1920px" class="img-fluid mb-3" caption="" webp="true" position="float-left" >}}

Along with the pre made voices, you also have the option to add your very own voice.

You can click on this or up on top you can click into the voice lab. Within the voice lab you have two different options for making a new synthetic voice from scratch. Over here you could design a voice or you can also clone a voice.

Let's start by looking at voice design.

{{< image src="images/blog/best-ai-voice-generator/9.webp" alt="alter-text" height="" width="1920px" class="img-fluid mb-3" caption="" webp="true" position="float-left" >}}

This opens up a prompt where I can now generate my very own voice.

At the top I can select a gender. I'll select male. I can also select the age.

I'll go with old, I can also select the accent.

And here I can define the accent strength. 

Down below I'll type in my text.

> First we thought the PC was a calculator. Then we found out how to turn numbers into letters and we thought it was a typewriter.

And down here I'll click on generate. 

<audio controls=""><source src="/sounds/3.mp3"></audio>

{{< image src="images/blog/best-ai-voice-generator/10.webp" alt="alter-text" height="" width="1920px" class="img-fluid mb-3" caption="" webp="true" position="float-left" >}}

We're going to have to use this in our next marketing campaign. Here I'll minimize this section on the bottom and then I can select use voice. Here I can give my voice a name.

I'll type in a name and then click on create voice. Now anytime that I want to synthesize text to speech I can use this specific voice. So this might become the voice of our marketing campaigns.

And this way I can ensure that we always have the same exact voice. 

#### Add Voice Using Voice Cloning

{{< image src="images/blog/best-ai-voice-generator/11.webp" alt="alter-text" height="" width="1920px" class="img-fluid mb-3" caption="" webp="true" position="float-left" >}}

Let's now add another voice. But this time we're going to use the instant voice cloning.

{{< image src="images/blog/best-ai-voice-generator/12.webp" alt="alter-text" height="" width="1920px" class="img-fluid mb-3" caption="" webp="true" position="float-left" >}}

And just like that, it has now added my voice. And it went really fast. It probably only took about ten or 15 seconds to add my voice.

Right down here I can now use my voice. 

Let's test this out.

{{< image src="images/blog/best-ai-voice-generator/13.webp" alt="alter-text" height="" width="1920px" class="img-fluid mb-3" caption="" webp="true" position="float-left" >}}

<audio controls=""><source src="/sounds/4.mp3"></audio>

Personally, I don't think it sounds like me that much.

#### History and Download Samples

{{< image src="images/blog/best-ai-voice-generator/14.webp" alt="alter-text" height="" width="1920px" class="img-fluid mb-3" caption="" webp="true" position="float-left" >}}

Once you've converted text into speech, click into the history tab and here you can see a history of all of your different generated samples. 

You can play them back again to hear what they sound like.

And if you'd like to download any of the generated speech, you can click on this icon and then you can download the selected speech.
