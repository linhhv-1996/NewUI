#### Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari

{{< image src="images/blog/10-life-changing-books-that-save-you-time-and-money/2.webp" alt="alter-text" height="" width="1920px" class="img-fluid mb-3" caption="" webp="true" position="float-left" >}}

Step into the annals of time with this captivating book, which delves into the fascinating history of human existence. From our humble beginnings to our current dominance, this narrative explores the intricacies of human evolution. 

Along the way, the author offers thought-provoking reflections on various aspects of human society, including culture, economics, and the pursuit of happiness, providing a rich and nuanced understanding of our species.

> “Biology enables, Culture forbids.”

The author says that culture is known to claim that it doesn’t allow behaviors that are unnatural. The question arises, what is an ‘unnatural’ behavior? The author claims whatever is possible is also natural.

Makes you think, doesn’t it?

> “As far as we can tell from a purely scientific viewpoint, human life has absolutely no meaning.”

Harari also critiques religion. His critique is similar to that of Richard Dawkins. Humans are the outcome of an evolutionary process and there is no rhyme and reason to our existence.

This book is a good contribution to the history and philosophy genre and will make you ponder a lot.

#### The Personal MBA: Master the Art of Business by Josh Kaufman

{{< image src="images/blog/10-life-changing-books-that-save-you-time-and-money/3.webp" alt="alter-text" height="" width="1920px" class="img-fluid mb-3" caption="" webp="true" position="float-left" >}}

Unlock the secrets of business without the hefty tuition fees! This book provides a comprehensive crash course on the fundamentals of business, covering essential topics such as the purpose of a business, its life cycle, and how to successfully create one. 

Josh Kaufman's expert guidance offers a wealth of knowledge, equivalent to an MBA education, from the comfort of your own home.

The aim of a business is to create value for its customers. The author identifies 5 parts essential to every business:
- Value-creation
- Marketing
- Sales
- Value Delivery
- Finance

> “Learn everything you can from your competition, and then create something even more valuable.”

Kaufman is of the view that business knowledge can be gained through self-study. And that belief of his is solidified in this book.

We learn about systems, processes, decision-making, statistics, and a lot more.

> “You can’t make positive discoveries that make your life better if you never try anything new.”

The author tells us about the life cycle of a business. It includes the following:
- Idea
- Start-up
- Growth
- Established
- Expansion

If you want to go for an MBA, I am not the one to say you shouldn’t. My recommendation is to read this book before you apply.

#### Man’s Search for Meaning by Viktor E Frankl

{{< image src="images/blog/10-life-changing-books-that-save-you-time-and-money/4.webp" alt="alter-text" height="" width="1920px" class="img-fluid mb-3" caption="" webp="true" position="float-left" >}}

Viktor E Frankl recounts his experience as a prisoner of Nazis during the Holocaust.

> “The majority of prisoners suffered from a kind of inferiority complex. We all had once been or had fancied ourselves to be ‘somebody.’ Now we were treated like complete nonentities.”

Everyone possesses self-value. The author says that this value is anchored in higher things. But in the camp, the prisoners’ view of themselves took a nosedive.

That’s what being treated like nothing does to you.

Frankl argues that it is possible to survive the various ups and downs of life if one assigns meaning to his/her life.

> “The meaning of life is unique to each individual; no one can be replaced.”

Discover a profound perspective on life's greatest mystery: its meaning. 

This thought-provoking book emphasizes that the answer lies not in asking the universe, but in finding it within ourselves. Even in the darkest of times, we possess the power of choice, and it's this freedom that allows us to create our own purpose and forge our own path.

> “No matter the circumstance, you always have the last of the human freedoms: to choose your attitude.”

This book is like a light shining through the prison windows.

#### The Psychology of Money: Timeless lessons on wealth, greed, and happiness by Morgan Housel

{{< image src="images/blog/10-life-changing-books-that-save-you-time-and-money/5.webp" alt="alter-text" height="" width="1920px" class="img-fluid mb-3" caption="" webp="true" position="float-left" >}}

Get a handle on your financial life!

Understand your psychology in order to understand money.
Why is it that some people are more financially successful than others?

The author tells us how our background and experiences shape our financial habits.
Some are born rich, never having to worry about money. Others are born poor. Some are born into families that value education and vice versa.
And then there is luck and risk. No matter how perfect a decision you make, luck and risk might have other plans for you.

> “…the world is too complex to allow 100% of your actions to dictate 100% of your outcomes.”

Get ready for a financial wake-up call! 

Housel's insightful book reveals the harsh truth about our spending habits and the crucial distinction between riches and wealth. He argues that true wealth lies in the money we can spend in the future, not in flashy displays of riches. By shifting our focus from short-term gains to long-term wealth, we can break free from the cycle of seeking validation through material possessions and instead earn respect through the virtues of our character.

> “Spending money to show people how much money you have is the fastest way to have less money.”

This book will help you see the importance of money and the good and bad choices related to it.

#### Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman

{{< image src="images/blog/10-life-changing-books-that-save-you-time-and-money/6.webp" alt="alter-text" height="" width="1920px" class="img-fluid mb-3" caption="" webp="true" position="float-left" >}}

Insights into the brain. The brain is the decision-making center. It takes in data from the surroundings and then makes the choice.

Brain employs various mental shortcuts for cognitive ease. It doesn’t always result in the right decisions. Why?

Because of the various biases and errors that occur as a result of deploying the shortcuts.

> “People tend to assess the relative importance of issues by the ease with which they are retrieved from memory — and this is largely determined by the extent of coverage in the media.”

The author also explains the difference between the ‘remembering self’ and the ‘experiencing self’. The former experiences the whole event. The latter remembers only what it wants to.

> “I call it theory-induced blindness: once you have accepted a theory and used it as a tool in your thinking, it is extraordinarily difficult to notice its flaws.”

This book is an in-depth look at the command center in our brain.

#### Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World by Cal Newport

{{< image src="images/blog/10-life-changing-books-that-save-you-time-and-money/7.webp" alt="alter-text" height="" width="1920px" class="img-fluid mb-3" caption="" webp="true" position="float-left" >}}

In a world where distractions reign supreme, Cal Newport's book is a timely reminder of the forgotten art of focus. As we increasingly struggle to concentrate, Newport argues that cultivating the ability to work without distraction is crucial for achieving success and finding fulfillment. 
A champion of balance in the digital age, he shows us how to reclaim our attention and unlock our full potential.

> “Human beings, it seems, are at their best when immersed deeply in something challenging.”

The philosophy of deep work doesn’t promote working all the time. It promotes working deeply when it is time to work. And not thinking about work when one is done.

> “When you work, work hard. When you’re done, be done.”

Cal Newport offers various strategies for working deeply. Those include:
- The monastic approach
- The bimodal approach
- The rhythmic approach
- The journalistic approach

As a busy parent, who works from home, I can’t say I have started applying deep work philosophy 100%. 
But I have definitely benefited from it.

#### Bird by Bird: Some Instructions on Writing and Life by Anne Lamott

{{< image src="images/blog/10-life-changing-books-that-save-you-time-and-money/8.webp" alt="alter-text" height="" width="1920px" class="img-fluid mb-3" caption="" webp="true" position="float-left" >}}

The secret passageway to becoming a great writer.
Anne Lamott is an author. This book compiles what she teaches in her creative writing classes.

> “Writing and reading decrease our sense of isolation. They deepen and widen and expand our sense of life: they feed the soul.”

The title of the book is connected to a childhood memory. Lamott’s brother had to write a report on birds. He was overwhelmed with all the material.

It was then their father put his arm around him and told him to do it ‘Bird by bird’.

The author advises us on how to approach a writing project and where to find inspiration.

> “Almost all good writing begins with terrible first efforts. You need to start somewhere.”

‘I am not a good writer,’ you might say. Well, worry not. Because Lamott consoles us that it’s the rite of passage. We are going to write badly at first.

This book is a must-read for aspiring writers.

#### The Joy of X: A Guided Tour of Math, from One to Infinity by Steven Strogatz

{{< image src="images/blog/10-life-changing-books-that-save-you-time-and-money/9.webp" alt="alter-text" height="" width="1920px" class="img-fluid mb-3" caption="" webp="true" position="float-left" >}}

Math in nature.

This book has 30 chapters. These chapters are divided into six parts. Those are:
- Numbers
- Relationships
- Shapes
- Change
- Data
- Frontiers

The author is a professor at Cornell. He shows us how mathematical concepts exist all around us.

> “The ripples on a pond, the ridges of sand dunes, the stripes of a zebra — all are manifestations of nature’s most basic mechanism of pattern formation: the emergence of sinusoidal structure from a background of bland uniformity.”

There are many interesting tidbits in the book too. Here is one. Strogatz says that 0.99 and the number 1 are the same.

At first, it might seem outrageous but when you read the reasoning it starts sounding less preposterous.

> “…math always involves both invention and discovery: we invent the concepts but discover their consequences.”

This book will make you appreciate the math that lies behind beauty and patterns.

#### Poor Charlie’s Almanack: The Essential Wit and Wisdom of Charles T. Munger by Charles T. Munger

{{< image src="images/blog/10-life-changing-books-that-save-you-time-and-money/10.webp" alt="alter-text" height="" width="1920px" class="img-fluid mb-3" caption="" webp="true" position="float-left" >}}

> “Acquire worldly wisdom and adjust your behavior accordingly. If your new behavior gives you a little temporary unpopularity with your peer group…then to hell with them.”

Charles T. Munder stands among the top ones. He was Warren Buffet’s partner and vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway. Munder died recently in November 2023, at the age of 99.

This book is a collection of his talks. They give us advice about life, business, and more.

> “It’s the work on your desk. Do well with what you already have and more will come in.”

#### The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene

{{< image src="images/blog/10-life-changing-books-that-save-you-time-and-money/11.webp" alt="alter-text" height="" width="1920px" class="img-fluid mb-3" caption="" webp="true" position="float-left" >}}

Why is this book banned in prisons?

We all want to be respected. We all want to have power. Maybe not the kind that kings and political leaders have, but in our own little world.

Well, Robert Greene has advice on that.

> “Do not leave your reputation to chance or gossip; it is your life’s artwork, and you must craft it, hone it, and display it with the care of an artist.”

Venture into the gray areas of human behavior with this provocative book, which has been deemed too controversial for US prisons. Blurring the lines between everyday advice and cunning tactics for manipulation, this thought-provoking read will leave you questioning the nature of influence and power. 

Prepare to be unsettled and intrigued as you delve into its pages, but be warned: once you've read it, there's no going back.

> “Never waste valuable time, or mental peace of mind, on the affairs of others — that is too high a price to pay.”

When we take our eyes off our own lives and meddle with what’s going on in the lives of others, we lose precious time. We also pay with our mental energy and peace.

Use this book for good. It will serve you well.
