We all know how important a compelling CTA is, and A/B testing is a great way to figure out which phrase generates more conversions. Just a note on that make sure everything else remains the same in your test so you know what's making the difference.

####  Test number 2:  App Store Listing

This is where potential users often get their first impression of your app, so it's crucial to make sure it's optimized to grab the attention of your target audience and generate installs. Focus on the most influential elements of your app store, listing which research shows are your app icon, screenshots, and video.

When it comes to your app icon, experiment with different colors and elements. If you have a game, why not experiment with different facial expressions of your characters? Get creative with your apps screenshots. Try different orientations like portrait or landscape to see which drives more in stalls.

Test different concepts does social proof like positive reviews or awards work better than simply showing your product? You can also shuffle your screenshots to determine the best order to display them in. Make sure your videos are short and show your USP. Test different features colors and durations.

But keep in mind that in the Apple app Store, videos start automatically and may not reflect user engagement. Remember to test each element on both the App Store and the Google Play Store, as each has a unique audience and will interact differently. 

#### Test number 3:  App Landing Page

This page is a crucial touch point where potential users land after clicking on an ad or a search result. It's your opportunity to showcase your app's unique value proposition and convert visitors into users. To increase your landing page's conversion rate, try A/B testing different hierarchies.

For example, you could test whether an f shaped pattern where visitors first read the page in a horizontal direction, then move down the page and read across a second horizontal line, or a z shaped pattern where visitors read content in a zigzag from top to bottom. Consider the ultimate goal of your landing page and then test different elements that can impact the desired action. For example, you could test the quantity and variety of social proof content, the headline used on the page design elements like colors, fonts and images, and of course, the call to action.

#### Test number 4: Onboarding Flow

Did you know that **50% of apps are uninstalled within the first day of download?** That's why optimizing the initial interaction with your app is crucial to maximize user engagement and reduce churn. Let's take the example of a fitness app.

They might want to run an A/B test to see if a traditional or gamified onboarding experience is more engaging for users. Split A could show a series of screens that the user can swipe through at their own pace. While split B might present an interactive quiz that assesses the users fitness goals and preferences.

Measuring the interaction over time will indicate which onboarding flow is the most engaging for their users. Now donâ€™t forget to mix things up. Experiment with the number, order and messaging of different steps in your onboarding flow to see what engages users the most and keeps them around for the long run.

#### Test number 5: In-app Messages

In app messages are a powerful tool to boost engagement, retention and revenue. That's why it's crucial to test different variants so you can see which messages really resonate with your users and which make them tune out.

When experimenting with in app messages, consider different stages of the user journey. What might work for a new user could be totally different from what works for an active user who uses your app every day. 

For example, a newbie might need some how to messages to get them up to speed.

While a seasoned pro might need some more advanced tips and tricks, try testing different types of messages and also experiment with different variants such as copy images or videos to see what really gets your users engaged. 

And last but not least, make sure to test the frequency of your messages. You want to keep your users informed and engaged without bombarding them with too many messages.

Firstly, define what you want to test and create a hypothesis. Identify the elements that can influence how your target audience interacts with your campaigns and app.

Secondly, test one element at a time to accurately measure the impact of each change. If you test multiple elements simultaneously, it can be difficult to pinpoint which element is responsible for any changes observed.
