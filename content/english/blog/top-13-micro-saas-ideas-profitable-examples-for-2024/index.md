Top 13 Micro SaaS Ideas - Profitable Examples for 2024.

That\'s going to give you some really good inspiration for each of these micro saas products. 

We\'ll be taking a look at what they do, who they were founded by and their overall revenue.

#### InAppStory - Redefining engagement strategies for businesses

{{< image src="images/blog/top-13-micro-saas-ideas-profitable-examples-for-2024/2.webp" alt="alter-text" height="" width="1920px" class="img-fluid mb-3" caption="" webp="true" position="float-left" >}}

Our first micro saas product is going to be called [InAppStory](https://inappstory.com/). It does around $7,000 in monthly revenue. It's going to be a b two b focused micro saas that's going to allow for full screen stories in your mobile app so you can extend the lifecycle of your mobile customers across the journey.

Allows for personalization, gamification, onboarding and short form videos. They've seen good results for their users with a three times better conversion rate versus banners and two minutes plus increase and average user sessions. And they have some cool brands using it such as WWF.

#### One Tab Group - Experience organized browsing like never before

{{< image src="images/blog/top-13-micro-saas-ideas-profitable-examples-for-2024/3.webp" alt="alter-text" height="" width="1920px" class="img-fluid mb-3" caption="" webp="true" position="float-left" >}}

Our next product is going to be called [One Tab Group](https://www.onetab.group/). This is a chrome extension that's all alternative to one tab and it makes it really easy to manage and group all your tabs in one place. It has a self reported revenue of around $1,000 a month and earlier this year they had a reported 3600 users.

So as mentioned, it's an all in one browser, tab and tab group manager we can see here. They've also added it to chrome Edge and Brave, giving them more platforms for their customers to use the tool. So overall a cool micro saas product that definitely serves a need and it gives you some features that aren't there normally, such as restoring tabs in a new window, creating different groups, suspending tabs and having different keyboard shortcuts.

For this micro saas, they actually went with more of a freemium model here cause there is a free plan with no signup needed. Other than that it's $2.49 a month or $50 for a lifetime offer.

Those are really more for those advanced features here. And that makes sense given they've had around 3600 users and a few hundred paying customers. 

#### MailRush - Powerful tool for optimizing and automating campaigns

{{< image src="images/blog/top-13-micro-saas-ideas-profitable-examples-for-2024/4.webp" alt="alter-text" height="" width="1920px" class="img-fluid mb-3" caption="" webp="true" position="float-left" >}}

The next micro saas we're looking at is a little bit of a larger one, doing around $22,000 a month in revenue.

It's called [MailRush](https://mailrush.io/) and it's a tool that lets you send cold emails and follow ups with no effort. It's an automation tool built for the B two b space and does other features such as email warm up, email validation and email follow ups. So if you to think about doing this process manually, it's very time consuming as you have to keep track of everything. Send out those emails and make sure you're following up correctly so you don't miss out on any leads. And that's where a tool such as mail rush can really come in.

Cold email is one that's hard to crack, as well as there's so many things you need to deal with with different spam filters and making sure there's enough personalization. And they also have features, features such as email warming, which is going to help improve the deliverability of your emails. They've also been working on some AI tool integration here and there's called their Spintax AI assistant that helps make crate dynamic and engaging cold email outreach a breeze.

So you're avoiding that content repetition and you can increase the chances of grabbing your recipients attention. Definitely a very cool outreach product. 

#### MentalPort App - Journey into the realm of mental health and well-being

{{< image src="images/blog/top-13-micro-saas-ideas-profitable-examples-for-2024/5.webp" alt="alter-text" height="" width="1920px" class="img-fluid mb-3" caption="" webp="true" position="float-left" >}}

Our next micro saas here is called [MentalPort](https://www.mentalport.health/en/mentalport-coaching-for-individuals).

It's available on the iOS and Android ecosystems, and it's an AI based mental health coach and everyday companion, and it's currently doing around $500 a month in reported revenue. It's gonna help you maintain your mental health here, making the process of it easier and fun through decision making for your next steps and integrating your personal gadgets. It's your personal coach that adapts to your needs and problems, and it's gonna use artificial intelligence for those who want to live life to their fullest.

#### Camocopy - a SaaS solution transforming visual content creation and management

{{< image src="images/blog/top-13-micro-saas-ideas-profitable-examples-for-2024/6.webp" alt="alter-text" height="" width="1920px" class="img-fluid mb-3" caption="" webp="true" position="float-left" >}}

Next, let's take a look at [Camocopy](https://www.camocopy.com/) and it's your privacy friendly AI assistant. It's doing a reported $5,000 a month in revenue. It's gonna be your regular assistant that you expect from tools just like chat GPT, but with one key difference, and that's an unwavering commitment to their privacy.

You can enjoy instant responses with Internet access sources, ultra realistic images, and you don't have to pay with your data. So we're gonna charge you based on the amount of words you use and the number of images created. And so these are one off payments here with no subscriptions.

And so you're gonna be paying with just dollars instead of selling your data. Privacy has become more of a big trend here. We've seen search engines such as DuckDuckGo take up quite a bit of share of search volume, and that's because people are caring about their privacy more.

So it makes sense here why there would be a tool focusing on that specific niche. 

#### PriceWell - Stripe Subscriptions Without Hiring a Developer

{{< image src="images/blog/top-13-micro-saas-ideas-profitable-examples-for-2024/7.webp" alt="alter-text" height="" width="1920px" class="img-fluid mb-3" caption="" webp="true" position="float-left" >}}

It's doing a reported $500 a month in revenue, and it has several co founders. It's trusted by over 500+ businesses and it integrates seamlessly with WordPress, Bubble, Webflow and Stripe. And this tool came out of a personal problem where the founder, Matthew Reed was building quite a few different side micro saas apps and he was always building stripe integrations.

So he came up with a tool to make this much easier. You can implement them in 1 hour, no coding required, and you can have instant price changes and you get other features such as being GDPR compliant. It's going to save you thousands of dollars on development and maintenance costs.

You can get features such as pricing pages, a customer portal and gated content. And it's going to work with website builders and no code platforms. 

#### CalenDesk - Go-to platform for seamless calendar management

They've been focusing on SEO for the long term here, and they have about 450 pages on Google and they're planning another 1.5 thousand. They hit 1000 users in two and a half months, which is really awesome to see.

#### Better Sheets - Your partner in efficient data management

This next micro saas is called [DatingKit](https://datingkit.io/) and it's a fully managed dating website. Software is doing a reported $2,500 a month and it was founded by a founder named Steven.

So there are a few big names in the online dating space aimed at startup dating sites. However, they're often loaded with features and according to the founder, they really missed the mark when it comes to streamlining revenue generating techniques. And that's where DatingKit comes in.

So you can create profitable dating websites made simple. So it's gonna be a fully managed solution with premium features, customer support, billing and software all optimized for conversions. 

#### OneTakeAI - shoot any video in one take

{{< image src="images/blog/top-13-micro-saas-ideas-profitable-examples-for-2024/12.webp" alt="alter-text" height="" width="1920px" class="img-fluid mb-3" caption="" webp="true" position="float-left" >}}

So definitely a really cool SaaS tool 

#### Receipt AI - Utilizing advanced technology for accurate and efficient financial management

{{< image src="images/blog/top-13-micro-saas-ideas-profitable-examples-for-2024/13.webp" alt="alter-text" height="" width="1920px" class="img-fluid mb-3" caption="" webp="true" position="float-left" >}}

[Receipt AI](https://receipt-ai.com/) is our next micro saas so you can manage your receipts with AI and SMS, saving 90% of your time by uploading receipts to Xero or Quickbooks from your phone. You don't even need Internet for it. And text receipts with ease in just 5 seconds. So it's going to save you as a business owner time having to upload all those receipts manually, and it's going to use their AI to do it for you. It's doing a reported $550 a month in revenue.

It’s has two co founders. They have over 1000 receipts uploaded, 1800 minutes saved, and $215,000+ expensed overall. So definitely a super cool tool here.

#### ProjectionLab - Simulate your financial future and chart a course toward your best life

{{< image src="images/blog/top-13-micro-saas-ideas-profitable-examples-for-2024/14.webp" alt="alter-text" height="" width="1920px" class="img-fluid mb-3" caption="" webp="true" position="float-left" >}}

And if we take a look at one of the examples, it can pull things such as the date, the name, the address, the phone number and the amount. And you can easily sync that in with your different accounting software.

[Projection Lab](https://projectionlab.com/) is a micro saas that does a reported $24,000 a month in revenue.

And it was founded by Kyle Nolan. And it was started because the founder had trouble finding a finance simulation tool that could actually model things in enough detail to ditch the spreadsheets. They didn't want to make you link real financial accounts, so they decided to build a tool that solved their own problem.

You can build financial plans you love, and simulate your financial future, and chart a course towards your best life. It's going to make it super easy to visualize this too, rather than just seeing numbers on a page. This makes sense too, because humans have a much better time understanding charts and graphs than they do looking at raw numbers.

And if we read the review from Brandon Ganch, Projection Lab is the most beautiful financial planning tool they've ever seen. And it's done a good job of pairing themselves with the fire movement, which I believe stands for financially independent, retire early.

It's a completely bootstrap product here. And in December, Kyle is able to leave their corporate job and go all in on their side project. So congratulations to Kyle.
