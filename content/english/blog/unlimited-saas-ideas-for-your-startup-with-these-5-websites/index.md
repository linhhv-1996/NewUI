Are you struggling to find the perfect SaaS idea for your startup? Say no more. 

In this article I am going to share 5 websites that will not only help you to find unlimited SaaS ideas, but they will also make your research process easier and some of these websites will become your main source of inspiration. 

I will also share a working strategy on how to analyze competitors fast and always come up with solid business ideas.

#### Appsumo

{{< image src="images/blog/unlimited-saas-ideas-for-your-startup-with-these-5-websites/2.webp" alt="alter-text" height="" width="1920px" class="img-fluid mb-3" caption="" webp="true" position="float-left" >}}

The first website in our list is this website might not be your main source of SaaS business ideas but you can always use it as a solid addition to all the websites.

Its always better to find an already working idea and use it as inspiration. The number of business ideas is always changing on [Appsumo](https://appsumo.com/). They update the list of companies and live only those products that are successful and make sales on a regular basis.

Our company was also listed on Appsumo back in 2022. We sold about 60 yearly subscriptions in several months we made a little bit more than 4k in profit, but then we decided to change our strategy and withdraw our app from the marketplace as it was not the traffic we were hoping for. Talking about the number of sales ideas the marketing and sales category offers the biggest number of business products that you might consider for building your own product.

You can explore other categories but as I mentioned before, this website should not be your main source of SaaS or any other business ideas. But you should never forget about Appsumo.

#### SaaS Hub

{{< image src="images/blog/unlimited-saas-ideas-for-your-startup-with-these-5-websites/3.webp" alt="alter-text" height="" width="1920px" class="img-fluid mb-3" caption="" webp="true" position="float-left" >}}

Moving to our next website that offers almost 200k SaaS ideas and the second website in our list is called [SaaS Hub](https://www.saashub.com/). 

SaaS Hub offers almost 200k products.

When I checked this website for the first time I couldn’t believe that for every idea that in my mind there were a bunch of alternative products, someone created them before I even started and some of them are quite successful. Most content creators use this website as the main source of SaaS ideas for creating shorts and long form videos on this topic. So knowing about the SaaS Hub and three more websites that are waiting for us next and in addition, using AI tools such as Jasper,  ChatGPT or Google Gemini for more detailed research will help you to find, analyze and validate any SaaS ideas for your business

#### SaaS Worthy

Our third website is called [SaaS Worthy](https://www.saasworthy.com/).

SaaS Worthy company is tracking more than 75k software. That means you have 75k SaaS and other business ideas to explore. To be honest I am tired of scrolling down categories.

The number of SaaS products there is uncountable. I think SaaS wars has almost every possible category listed and I found solid products in categories i’ve never heard of before. Lets say I want to create a SaaS invoicing software.

I know you can say Dane, there is a huge amount of invoice generators but I love numbers. I am stubborn and I know that I can find at least 10k monthly users for my sales business. I am choosing invoicing and billing software on our categories page.

{{< image src="images/blog/unlimited-saas-ideas-for-your-startup-with-these-5-websites/5.webp" alt="alter-text" height="" width="1920px" class="img-fluid mb-3" caption="" webp="true" position="float-left" >}}

I see a lot of results but I like exactly this one. Invoice home and I want to create a similar product to this one but do something different. I choose invoice home and then click on alternatives tab.

And here we go, 65 alternative invoice generators and I can take something from this one and from this one and the payment system from this one and at the end I will analyze, validate and start building my own invoice generator. Of course this website has not only SaaS products and you don’t need to create an exact copy of somebody’s product, you just need to find the right direction first and then to explore more about business model features and competitive advantage.

#### Wellfound 

{{< image src="images/blog/unlimited-saas-ideas-for-your-startup-with-these-5-websites/6.webp" alt="alter-text" height="" width="1920px" class="img-fluid mb-3" caption="" webp="true" position="float-left" >}}

We are moving forward and our fourth website is well found. Some of you might hear about [wellfound](https://wellfound.com/) and some of you might not.

Wellfound is formerly Angeles Talent is a startup job website. You can find there not only world leading SaaS companies and startups but also thousands of startups who have just started their journey. There is money from investors but they are not so popular right now and that might be your chances to find an unknown startup, take their idea, enhance it and try to build your own SaaS business.

I know, You could say Dane its not as easy as you recommend us to do. I will need to dive deep into the research stage, find competitors, the potential market size and so on.

And I would agree with you. So my goal is to share more websites to make your research process easier. The more websites you know, the more SaaS ideas you can always explore.

And a few words about wellfound.

{{< image src="images/blog/unlimited-saas-ideas-for-your-startup-with-these-5-websites/7.webp" alt="alter-text" height="" width="1920px" class="img-fluid mb-3" caption="" webp="true" position="float-left" >}}

When you click on a Discover page. You can find several links but were interested in a startup step.

As you already know that I love numbers. I want to build another SaaS startup in the fintech category so I choose it and see all fintech startups that are listed on this website. Most of the startups are medium sized companies but it should not always bother you because our goal is to find such business ideas.

So being in your place I would find a company that has under 50 employees and that is the kind of a new player on the market. Next thing I am going to do is to research their features and their target market. I would take the star feature as my main feature, but I am going to change my target market or business model or overall business approach and that's how I would convert somebody's SaaS ideas into my SaaS business.

Of course everything that I've just described is not about 10% of all the work you should do, but again, you don't need to copy businesses, find an idea, analyze, validate it and do something different. It may take a lot of time and you should always remember it.

#### Product Hunt

{{< image src="images/blog/unlimited-saas-ideas-for-your-startup-with-these-5-websites/8.webp" alt="alter-text" height="" width="1920px" class="img-fluid mb-3" caption="" webp="true" position="float-left" >}}

[Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/) is a must know website for every solopreneur, entrepreneur or business owner. And when you are building yourself us, I can find a better place to promote your SaaS at the beginning of your journey. 

But what about finding SaaS ideas? There are plenty of categories and a large number of products in each category.

I cant find the exact number of products that are currently on Product Hunt just because some data is old and a bunch of new products are launched daily. But one thing I know for sure, product hunt and other four websites should be your starting point and places where you can find inspiration for creating your own SaaS business. Research stage is always the hardest stage but its always worth it.

You can find a perfect idea and then you start to understand that there are a lot of other alternatives on the market and you cant compete. 

But that’s not only the reason why almost 90% of SaaS startups fail to avoid common mistakes when building your business.
